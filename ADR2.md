# Using React Router for Navigation

## Context
We need an efficient way to navigate between pages in our React application. Using manual state-based rendering with useState is inefficient and managing multiple div elements for conditional rendering is not scalable. Additionally, the browser's back and forward buttons should function correctly to enhance the user experience.

## Decision
We will use **React Router** to handle navigation in the application.

## Rationale
1. Declarative Routing simplifies navigation by providing a structured way to define routes in a React application.
2. React supports Nested Routes, making it easier to manage complex applications with multiple levels of navigation.
3. React enhances Browser Compatibility, ensuring smooth back and forward navigation for a better user experience.
4. Dynamic Route Handling enables route parameters (/user/:id) for better flexibility.
5. Better URL Management allows deep linking, bookmarkable URLs, and RESTful navigation.
6. React enhanced User Experience with smooth client-side navigation without full-page reloads, leading to faster and more interactive apps.


## Consequences
### Pros
We will have a highly efficient, scalable, and flexible frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces. React’s component-based architecture allows for reusable UI elements, improving development speed and maintainability. Additionally, client-side rendering ensures a smooth user experience with faster page updates.

### Cons
 Adopting React will require training our teams on React concepts, including hooks, state management, and component lifecycle methods. We will also need to set up and maintain routing, state management, and performance optimizations manually. Additionally, managing SEO with React requires extra configurations, such as server-side rendering (SSR) with frameworks like Next.js.

## Sample code

#### Router Configuration (`src/routes/AppRouter.jsx`)
```
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "../pages/Home";
import About from "../pages/About";

const AppRouter = () => {
  return (
    <Router>  
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default AppRouter;

```

#### Navigation Component (`src/components/Navbar.jsx`)

```
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <nav className="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white flex justify-between">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">MyApp</h1>
      <div>
        <Link to="/" className="mr-4">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navbar;

```

#### Main Entry (`src/main.jsx`)

```
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <nav className="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white flex justify-between">
      <h1 className="text-lg font-bold">MyApp</h1>
      <div>
        <Link to="/" className="mr-4">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navbar;

```

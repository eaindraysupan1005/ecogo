# Adopting React as the Frontend JavaScript Library

## Context
As we build a modern, scalable, and maintainable frontend for our application, we need to decide on the JavaScript library that best fits our requirements. We require a library that supports component-based architecture, efficient state management, and seamless integration with APIs.

## Decision
We have decided to use React as our frontend JavaScript library.

## Rationale
1. Component-Based Architecture – React allows us to break down the UI into reusable components, improving maintainability and modularity.
2. Virtual DOM for Performance – React’s Virtual DOM optimizes rendering performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
3. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support – React has extensive community support, third-party libraries, and a strong ecosystem, making development faster and easier.
4.  Flexibility with State Management – React provides hooks and can be integrated with state management libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React Context API based on project complexity.


## Consequences
### Pros
We will have improved code reusability and maintainability with React’s component-based architecture, making development more efficient. The Virtual DOM enables faster rendering, enhancing performance and user experience. Additionally, React has a strong ecosystem and developer support, providing access to numerous third-party libraries and community resources. Debugging is also easier with React Developer Tools, and we can leverage static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) using frameworks like Next.js for better performance and SEO. 

### Cons
Adopting React requires an initial learning curve to understand concepts like hooks, context, and effects. Managing state in complex applications can lead to boilerplate code, especially when using tools like Redux or Context API. Additionally, SEO optimization requires extra setup unless paired with Next.js for server-side rendering.

## Sample code

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Toggle is {isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>
        {isOn ? "Turn OFF" : "Turn ON"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Toggle;
```

This decision ensures that our frontend is scalable, maintainable, and performs optimally for our use case.
